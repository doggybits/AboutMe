# About Me
I grew up in Northern Virginia, right in the heart of the DMV (DC-Maryland-Virginia) area—a true melting pot of people, culture, and ideas. When I was around 15, my mom came home with a Dell Optiplex 390, and that moment changed everything for me. Up until then, I was mostly into console gaming—PlayStation, Xbox, GameCube—but the world of the internet completely blew me away.

Soon I was diving deep into the web: downloading P2P content, watching videos, and even customizing my MySpace profile using HTML. One memory that really sticks with me is getting my hands on a 5th Gen iPod Classic. I couldn’t afford to buy songs, so I turned to Limewire—because of course, that made sense at 15. That decision ended with my mom writing a check to Geek Squad for a full reimage of that Optiplex. But instead of feeling defeated, I thought, “If they can fix it, why can’t I?” That moment planted a seed.

Fast forward to my time serving in the 110th Infantry Regiment—tech wasn’t even on my radar. It took leaving the military and reflecting on what I really wanted to do to lead me back to something I’d always loved: figuring things out, building, fixing, and learning. That’s when I decided to enroll at Northern Virginia Community College and study Cybersecurity.

At first, I had barely any idea what cybersecurity even meant (and truthfully, I’m still learning). But after my first semester, I was hooked. I discovered Linux for the first time and felt like I’d stepped into a new world. Learning about Richard Stallman and the history of open-source software was like watching a movie—and exploring different Linux distributions became a challenge I couldn’t get enough of. Every time something finally worked at the kernel level, it felt like a personal victory.

To keep learning and stay hands-on, I started homelabbing—setting up services on my own equipment at home to serve real purposes for me and my family. I love working in the terminal. It’s where I feel focused and in control. Lately, I’ve been finding myself at a bit of a crossroads: I’m passionate about System Administration, but I’m also fascinated by how systems break and what happens when they do.

Either way, I know I’m in the right place—and I’m just getting started.
